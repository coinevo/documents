# Evo Mobile Wallet (Android)

We have finally! updated our legacy Evo Mobile wallet for Android, it was an overdue update and we're glad to have a new release which also looks great!.



# How to use the All-New Evo Android Wallet

## 1. Create New Wallet
To use Evo Wallet for the first time or create new Evo Wallet, you could use the Create New button on the login page of the APP. In order to setup your wallet, you will need to enter your PIN twice, which will be used for logging in and making transactions later. Then, the system will randomly generate 12 seed words that are used to recover the wallet. These seed words should be kept safely and securely to avoid from being stolen. After backing up your seed words, you'll need to input them in the correct order to verify your account. After this, your wallet will be successfully created.

##2. Recover Wallet / Import Wallet
When you forget the transaction password of your Evo Wallet, you can setup new transaction password by recovering your wallet. By using the Import Wallet function on the APP's login page, you can also import an existing wallet account when you switch your phone or change wallet application. There are two ways to import a wallet: 1. import seed words; 2. import private key. If you're importing seed words from a mobile or web wallet, the original transaction password will be needed as well. After importing your wallet successfully, enter your password twice and you'll complete the process.
