# How to update your Evo wallet

Updating your Evo wallet is quite easy, however, this process changes depending on which operating system you're running, in this document we'll go over the following OS:

Keeping your Evo wallet up-to-date is one of the most important tasks that any staker, holder, developer and any type of Evo user must do. 

The process itself is quite simple, however it does vary depending on the operating system you're using.

## Update Evo on Windows

Here's a video on how to update your Evo wallet [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNsdGXYUfUc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNsdGXYUfUc) - you can use this document as support for the video.

In this example, we're running a 0.17.6 Evo wallet version on Windows, it is outdated and won't be part of the hardfork, (we need to update ASAP).

However, if we're running the wallet (staking or just left it open), we need to do the following;

1. Close the wallet

2. Download latest Evo wallet version from either one of these links:
