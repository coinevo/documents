# How to run a Evo Lightning network node

Evo has now its own implementation of the lightning network, it uses the eclair client. Currently, this is only supported on testnet, let's check how to set it up and run our very own lightning network client!. 

it is recommended to run **Debian 10 (buster)** as it has all the library versions we need

# Install Evo Core

Let's go ahead and install Evo on our Debian 10, the easy way is to use the Evo Debian repository:

## Enable the Evo repository

#### Installing dirmngr and apt-transport-https

These two packages are needed to enable the Evo repository on Debian, let's install them:

`apt install -y apt-transport-https dirmngr`

### Adding repository to your APT sources.

`sudo su` - Sudo to root first

`echo "deb https://repo.coinevo.tech/apt/debian/ buster main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/evo.list`

## Add Evo key

Before installing, we need to add the Evo apt key

`sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys BF5B197D`

### Refreshing APT sources and installing Evo

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install evo`

Evo should be installed now, let's continue

## Create Evo configuration file

We need to create the .evo folder manually, also, we will create the configuration file inside of that folder, here's how:

`mkdir ~/.evo`

`nano ~./evo/evo.conf` 

This will create a text file using the **nano** editor, copy/paste the following inside that file:

server=1  

rpcuser=foo  

rpcpassword=bar  

txindex=1  

addresstype=bech32  

zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:29000  

zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:29000

# Install Evo Eclair - Lightning client

Let's install some dependencies to prepare for the lightning client:

## **Install JDK and Maven**

Evo Eclair is developed using the Scala language. To run Evo Eclair, you must first install the JDK, and OpenJDK 11 or above is recommended.

> apt-get install default-jdk
> 
> apt install maven

## **Build Evo Eclair**

Now that we have every dependency installed, it's time to build the Eclair lightning client for Evo. Again, inside our terminal we type:

- `git clone https://github.com/coinevo/lightning-demo.git`
- `cd lightning-demo`
- `mvn install -DskipTests`

You should see something like this, if there's no errors, we can proceed with creating the configuration file and launch Evo Eclair now.

## **Run Evo Eclair**

Create and edit the configuration file ~/.evo-eclair/eclair.conf as follows:

eclair {  
 chain = "testnet" // "mainnet" for mainnet, "testnet" for testnet, "regtest" for regtest

**PLEASE NOTE** if you modified the rpcuser and rpcpassword on evo.conf, please modify this config file accordingly .

# Launch Evo Eclair lightning client

Start the client with the command **java -jar ./eclair-node-gui/target/lightning-capsule.jar**

You should see the eclair desktop client as on the screenshot below:![](1.png)

# **Create a lightning network channel**

![](2.png)

Right-click the lower left corner of the local Evo Eclair client and select “Copy URI” to get its node address (public key).

![](3.png)

Click the “Channel” button in the upper left corner and select “Open Channel”.

![](4.png)

In the pop-up page, fill in the URI of the channel partner, and the capacity of the channel, which is set to 10 EVO as an example, this will be the maximum capacity for this channel, this means, you can only transact up to 10 EVO.

 Click “Connect” to create the channel. At this point, you need to wait for 6 blocks to confirm the transaction and the channel will be created successfully.

![](5.png)

# **Lightning Network Payment**

Once the channel is set up, you can use the Lightning Network for micropayments.

![](7.png)

Click the “Channel” button in the upper left corner, select “Receive Payment”, fill in the receipt amount in the pop-up page, click the “Generate” button to get your own receipt address. Here we choose a very small amount of 1 Satoshi, which is equivalent to 0.00000001 EVO. Such a small transferred amount is unimaginable without using a lightning network.

![](8.png)

Click the “Channel” button in the upper left corner, select “Send Payment”, fill in the other party’s lightning network receipt address and amount in the pop-up page, and click the “Send” button, then you can transfer tokens to the other party.

After the transfer is completed, the amount of the two parties’ changes instantaneously. Because this is a pure transaction off the chain, there is no need to wait for the block confirmation, and it is free of fees.

# **Close the channel for settlement**

The channel can be closed when the channel is no longer needed.

![](9.png)

Click the “Close” button to close the channel.

![](10.png)

Once closed, the remaining EVO in the channel will be refunded to the origin Evo Core wallet.
