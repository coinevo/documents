# Commands

The Evo Core wallet has a rich set of commands which give comprehensive control of the wallet and blockchain transactions. There are two sets of commands that may be used with Evo Core wallets:

* Console commands are given to a wallet that is already running.
* Startup commands are used when starting up a wallet.

This manual focuses on the console commands which are given to a wallet that is running and can be sent using RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) or on the command line to the evod server wallet or given to the evo-qt desktop GUI (Graphical User Interface) wallet using the Debug window Console command line (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. The evo-qt Console

Note the warning message in red in Figure 1 and be careful using the private key commands (`dumpprivkey` and `dumpwallet`) with Mainnet wallets.


For the server wallet evod, console commands are given using the Command Line Interface application evo-cli on the system command line prompt (see Figure 2).

You can always get a list of the current console commands using the help command (see Figure 3.)

## Console Commands :hammer_and_wrench:

Console commands are given to a running Evo Core wallet and provide additional information and control. Console commands and are required to operate the evod server wallet, which is a "headless" wallet with no graphical user interface.

There are 136 console commands with some good references for the 112 inherited from bitcoin. There are 13 "hidden" commands that are used by developers and won't show up in the "help" list.

Commands can have required or optional parameters and more numerous parameters are entered in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format with escaped double quotes ( \" ) as shown below.

Common parameters for these commands are Evo addresses, block hashes, contract addresses, etc. Some of the commands will have an optional parameter "minconf" (minimum confirmations) which allows you to get a response for a transaction or block that has at least that number of confirmations.

The chain query bitcoin API reference http://chainquery.com/bitcoin-api explains the parameters and gives examples with responses for the commands inherited from bitcoin. The bitcoin chain query API reverence gives 67 commands, of which 2 are not in Evo (`estimatepriority`, `getgenerate`) and two (`gettransaction`, `walletpassphrase`) have an additional parameter for Evo. See also https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#remote-procedure-calls-rpcs.


Advanced interfaces to the Evo Core wallet (full node) can use these "console commands" as RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls) over a dedicated port connection to the node. To build an exchange hot wallet or server node for a mobile DAPP (Distributed Application) you can use RPCs, which follow these same console commands. The client node offers a JSON-RPC interface over HTTP sockets to perform various operational functions and to manage the local node.

A quick comment on "accounts". Accounts was an ill-fated way from bitcoin to track balances for what are really UTXO transaction-based values, and "accounts" are deprecated and will be phased out by version 0.18.

Here are some command groupings that are useful for various tasks:

* Peer connections: `getconnectioncount`, `getpeerinfo`, `addnodes`, `getnetworkinfo`
* Staking: `getstakinginfo`, `getwalletinfo`, `getnetworkinfo`
* Sending: `listaddressgroupings`, `sendtoaddress`, `sendmany`, `sendmanywithdupes`
* Raw transactions: `crearterawtransaction`, `signrawtransaction`, `combinerawtransactoins`, `sendrawtransaction`
* Smart contract transactions: `createcontract`, `callcontract`, `sendtocontract`, `getaccountinfo`, `getstorage`, `searchlogs`, `waitforlogs`

## Startup Commands

Startup commands give additional control and recovery options when launching the wallet. For example, you can use startup commands for various kinds of blockchain recovery techniques, additional debug logging or additional controls. If you are going to use these startup commands, make sure you have a good backup of the wallet.dat file.

See the startup commands on the evo-qt wallet with Help - Command line options:

![2019-4 Startup Commands Win](https://i.imgur.com/CryGF13.jpg)
Figure 4. Startup commands

and on the command line itself with "evod -?":

Figure 5. Startup commands from the command line


## Console Commands A - Z

For these console commands documented below, responses are given for default parameters (Evo version 0.16 - winter 2018/2019). Commands marked DEPRECATED should not be used because they will be removed and replaced in future versions of the wallet, for example, commands using "account" will be removed in version 0.18.

Using the command "help \<command name\>" will give complete information about the command and relevant parameters, formatted in a way you can copy and paste (replacing the addresses, transactions IDs, etc., as required). The format below shows the command with parameters followed by the response, in some cases, parameters or responses are truncated with the term "\<snip\>". Where noted, some commands only work with the regtest (Regression Test) network. Many commands will return "null" for evo-qt and return nothing for command line systems.

### abandontransaction "txid"

Works on transactions not in the blockchain or mempool, used in testing.

```
abandontransaction "0cc99a30bc2064041ea4263835b4ed594ff500c56d6b14e4970aeee548e71389"

Transaction not eligible for abandonment (code -5)
```

### abortrescan

Stops a wallet rescan triggered by a command such as `importprivkey`. This command can be issued by opening a 2nd command line window (where the first window is scanning), in which case the command will stop the scan and return "true".


```
evo-cli abortrescan

true
```

### addmultisigaddress nrequired ["key",...] ( "account" "address_type" )

Add a multisignature address to the wallet so you can receive and send from that address. Run the command on each machine that will be signing and backup the wallet.dat file. The address can be a Evo address or hex-encoded public key. Use `importaddress` to add the multisig address on each signing wallet.

This functionality is only intended for use with non-watchonly addresses. See `importaddress` for watchonly p2sh address support. Use of account is DEPRECATED). See also `validateaddress`.


```
addmultisigaddress 2 "[\"QgdaD9b3ppKowoC45EZMtepjjBfnvEe6m\",\"QFmr8vY29reHj73XSHfdWvkV3mD57Kqd8\"]"

{
  "address": "mHB9w64hHbm2YtCxyqS8kG3g77b2gbSvK",
  "redeemScript": "5321538ef45ab52bd53508adfda3cfe82ebcaf0495963729e5ff2a8e5aeecdd4cdd23daea03cf4394ad4c578caff2d297ce937c3afba5bc56f31c786b2addf56c72ab"
}
```

### addnode "node" "add|remove|onetry"

Attempts to add a node with a known IP address. This command is useful for new wallets that are having trouble making peer connections. Here are some good IP addresses to add, you can put these commands in one after another, then the wallet will try for a few minutes to make a peer connection with each. Evod returns nothing:

```
addnode 35.200.159.68:3888 add
addnode 35.197.138.163:3888 add
addnode 35.226.31.206:3888 add
addnode 35.200.130.53:3888 add
addnode 35.192.54.161:3888 add
```


Evo-qt returns "null" after each (see Figure 6).

![2019-6 addnode Mac](https://i.imgur.com/RjRkiP8.jpg)
Figure 6. Entering the addnode command

### addwitnessaddress "address" ( p2sh )

Hidden command. DEPRECATED. This command was a way to generate a SegWit address from an existing legacy address, usually a P2SH-P2WPKH addresses - Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH) script embedded in a Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) address. This command is mostly disabled in version 0.16 and will be removed in version 0.17. Instead, use the `getnewaddress` command with address type "p2sh-segwit" or "bech32".

Launch v 0.16 evod with `-deprecatedrpc=addwitnessaddress` to run the command:
     

```
addwitnessaddress QkSc3wcAJ59Nk4X9mvd258ycVxJ7XWhp9

MHa57hGwD48SZQjh23MZbq24tFwTu7Q3c
```

### backupwallet "destination"

The destination can be a filename or path with a filename. The wallet must be fully decrypted (not just for staking only) for this command to work. evo-qt will returns "null", evod returns nothing. On Windows:

```
backupwallet "C:\Users\<username>\Desktop\Backups\backup2018-10-21.dat"

null
```

### bumpfee "txid" ( options )

Bumps the fee of a transaction, replacing it with a new transaction by adjusting the change. The new fee can be calculated automatically or by using various options.

```
bumpfee "cae25062777fca1bce7f860dd238af2be4495f4aef1b5a15bbee260b4c3cde2"

{
  "txid": "ecbc798c140b5104ae3d5828493e8e5ef04131dd0e44eb7fa7e1abba24901a5",
  "origfee": 0.00090400,
  "fee": 0.00093061,
  "errors": [
  ]
}
```

### callcontract "address" "data" ( address )

Arguments:
1. "address"          (string, required) The account address
2. "data"             (string, required) The data hex string
3. address              (string, optional) The sender address hex string
4. gasLimit             (string, optional) The gas limit for executing the contract

TO COME
     

### clearbanned

Clear all banned nodes IPs. Evo-qt returns "null", evod gives no response.

```
clearbanned

null
```

### combinerawtransaction ["hexstring",...]

Combine multiple partially signed raw transactions into one transaction. The combined transaction may be another partially signed transaction or a fully signed transaction. Here two raw transactions are combined:

```
combinerawtransaction "[\"0200000001b<snip>000000\", \"0200000001c<snip>000000\"]"

0200000001b<snip>000000
```

### createcontract "bytecode" (gaslimit gasprice "senderaddress" broadcast)

Publish a smart contract for the given bytecode, using default gas price of 0.00000040 and gas amount of 2,500,000. Returns the transaction ID and the contract address hash.

```
createcontract 60606040<snip>41701d0029

{
  "txid": "a1d823cb5ce776200dcbe729d901d4e1d31ad5bb8d835db0f704g73ac8e74d3",

  "address": "4853cd349027fe239fed85837456b3c48aae42a"
}
```

### createmultisig nrequired ["key",...]

DEPRECATED. Use `addmultisigaddress`.

### createrawtransaction [{"txid":"id","vout":n},...] {"address":amount,"data":"hex",...} ( locktime ) ( replaceable )

Create a hex-encoded raw transaction sending some inputs to outputs. The transaction must then be signed and sent to the network, see `signrawtransaction` and `sendrawtransaction`. Returns a hex-encoded raw transaction. If you are sending coins make sure to create a change address so the change can be returned; any difference between the input values and output values will be taken as the transaction fee. If you don't work out the math you could pay a big transaction fee.
     

```
createrawtransaction "[{\"txid\":\"17b3f9ef530695ef2e0368e445a3b59bf12811bdfd42325bb14248e72deb7e2\",\"vout\":0}]" "{\"Qd5eHho389mJMCxSzAbe31w2vntTc7192\":1.0, \"QdXtq55Bf443Lkme2hdj4mD8KKepk32f6\":0.99}"

```

### decoderawtransaction "hexstring" ( iswitness )

Gives the decoded data from a raw hex-encoded transaction. Here we decode the results from `createrawtransaction` above.
     

```
decoderawtransaction 0200000<snip>f33ad0000000

      "value": 1.00000000,
<snip>
    }
  ]
}
```

### decodescript "hexstring"

Decode a hex-encoded script, for example, decode the script for a mulitsig address:

```
decodescript 52460396bc49812bad50949fbc0bbd44e95bf32a5695519b3ff267a5d93cba3bd169b2393cd4864da4c2786dd3322fcfcb239c3db185ef33fa14836b8fecf36c68bb84ddac92f2

  ],
  "p2sh": "mKa7c52cX97eK4vdk35jV442p3j59hk3R"
}
```

### disconnectnode "[address]" [nodeid]

Disconnects a peer (node) using either the IP address or node number. Evo-qt will return "null", evod will return nothing.

```
disconnectnode "35.198.0.76:3888"

null
```

### dumpprivkey "address"

Displays the private key for a given address in WIF (Wallet Import Format). The wallet must be unlocked (and not for "staking only") for this command to work.

```
dumpprivkey "QXfSbN8DaT21Z6L3Pw52UexuP8zW4mY6h"

L3vaEHms4VpciP85UsufQf3Gfa9p5gatBGm6Z4rD8FxzFLdXE5V
```

### dumpwallet "filename"

Writes all the wallet private keys to a file in clear text (unencrypted) format. The wallet must be fully decrypted (not just for staking only) for this command to work. Returns the filename. Dumpwallet will save all the private keys and their addresses; it will not save watchonly addresses (which do not have private keys in the wallet). This file contains all the private keys in the wallet (1,000 or more), be very careful and do not store the dump file online.

On PC:

```
dumpwallet "C:\Users\<username>\Desktop\Backups\dump 2018-10-30.txt"

{
  "filename": "C:\\Users\\<username>\\Desktop\\Backups\\dump 2018-10-30.txt"

### encryptwallet "passphrase"

Encrypts the wallet with "passphrase" for first-time encryption. After encryption, any calls that interact with private keys such as sending or signing will require passphrase entry to enable these functions. See also `walletpassphrase`, `walletlock` and `walletpassphrasechange`. After this command runs, the wallet will shut down.
     
     
```
encryptwallet "you should always use a long and strong passphrase"
```
(wallet exits)

### echo "message"

Hidden command. Simply echo back the input arguments. This command is for testing.

The difference between `echo` and `echojson` is that `echojson` has argument conversion enabled in the client-side table in evo-cli and the GUI. There is no server-side difference. Here we echo the parameters used to setup a multisig address.
     
     
```
echo "[\"qghwDvb1pyJoqoAD2ESMTevvvjUfNvReDn\",\"qfKr7vXdmroHi61XUUHedXvgV2mDx9Kudb\"]"

[
  "[\"qghwDvb1pyJoqoAD2ESMTevvvjUfNvReDn\",\"qfKr7vXdmroHi61XUUHedXvgV2mDx9Kudb\"]"
]
```

```

### estimatefee nblocks

DEPRECATED. Please use `estimatesmartfee` for better estimates. Estimates the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin confirmation within nblocks blocks.
     

```
estimatefee 10

estimatefee is deprecated and will be fully removed in v0.17.
```

### estimaterawfee conf_target (threshold)

Hidden command. WARNING: This command is unstable and may disappear or change, and the results are tightly coupled to the calling parameters.

Gives fee estimates for short, medium, and long term confirmations, and gives mempool statistics for transactions with those fees. Estimates the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin confirmation within conf_target blocks.

### fromhexaddress "hexaddress"

Converts a raw hex address to a base 58 pubkeyhash address. Returns the base58 pubkeyhash address.

```
fromhexaddress 9467c4cbd6c4bb736cf4724de25a298bc529bfa3

QXvN7L3D2NkdPgt20rYrGkSPCggwkKbqa
```
     

See `gethexaddress` to convert a base58 pubkeyhash to a hex address.

### fundrawtransaction "hexstring" ( options iswitness )

Select and add inputs to a transaction until it has enough in value to meet its out value. Collects one or more unspent transactions as inputs, and computes and specifies the change amount. Note that inputs which were signed may need to be resigned after completion since in/outputs have been added. The inputs added will not be signed, use `signrawtransaction` for that.
      

```
fundrawtransaction "02000000000140620b00000000001875c9289dc9ffac451edb8229dd6e95221cd3b5c23af2698ec00000000"

}
```

### generate nblocks ( maxtries )

Mine up to nblocks blocks immediately to an address in the wallet. Used with the regression test "regtest" private test blockchain. Can use `generate 1` to publish waiting transactions in the next block, or `generate 600` to initialize a new regtest blockchain.
      

```
docker exec myapp qcli generate 600

### getnewaddress ( "account" "address_type" )

Get a new receiving address, with types "legacy", "p2sh-segwit" or "bech32". Evo Mainnet legacy addresses start with a "Q", and SegWit addresses will start with an "M" for p2sh-segwit and "qc1" for bech32. Evo Testnet legacy addresses start with a "q", and SegWit addresses will start with an "m" for p2sh-segwit and "tq1" for bech32. Here we get a new Mainnet SegWit bech32 address:

```
getnewaddress "" "bech32"

qc1q52g2c283225pfdm2wqdsk45aufm4urtcdp9d5
```

### getpeerinfo

### importaddress "address" ( "label" rescan p2sh )

Adds a 34-character Evo address or 66 hex character public key address that can be watched as if it were in your wallet but cannot be used to spend. The wallet will rescan after entering this command and should be backed up after adding addresses. Evo-qt returns "null" and displays the "Watch-only" balance, evod returns nothing.

```
importaddress QaL29jcCZ39pWcA334dA4BN3peVhnc42D

null
```

### importmulti "requests" ( "options" )

Import multiple addresses/scripts (with private or public keys, redeem script (P2SH)), rescanning the blockchain for all the new addresses in a single pass. Optional time stamps can control how far back the scanning begins for each address. Requires a new wallet backup after addition of the addresses.

Here we import two watch only addresses and scan the blockchain from 00:00:00 hours GMT on June 1, 2018 (timestamp 1527811200). After entering the command, the wallet will take several minutes to rescan the blockchain for the new addresses:

```
importmulti '[{ "scriptPubKey": { "address": "QX4kcv3ZWZpax2tb44tpiv7q3wEB8Sek5" }, "timestamp":1527811200 }, { "scriptPubKey": { "address": "QN3BkewbR37fQs226ZA2qkh83mKS529B" }, "timestamp": 1527811200 }]'

importmulti(Ö)

[
  {
    "success": true
  },
  {
    "success": true
  }
]
```

### importprivkey "evoprivkey" ( "label" ) ( rescan )

Adds a WIF private key to your wallet, for example as returned by dumpprivkey or from another Evo wallet. The wallet must be unlocked and requires a new wallet backup afterwards. The wallet will rescan for a few minutes to add any balance from the new address, and return "null" if successful.

```
importprivkey cThA5YBGQggmpjSsBFLT1NXR18Fk16YBNd1kCVoERjbQ4d4TRMFf

null
```

### importprunedfunds

Imports funds without rescan. Corresponding address or script must previously be included in wallet. Aimed towards pruned wallets. The end-user is responsible to import additional transactions that subsequently spend the imported outputs or rescan after the point in the blockchain the transaction is included.

Example TO COME.

### importpubkey "pubkey" ( "label" rescan )

Adds a public key that can be watched as if it were in your wallet but cannot be used to spend. The public key is 66 characters hex, and can be obtained using the `validateaddress` command. After entering this command, the wallet will rescan for a few minutes, evo-qt returns "null" and evod returns nothing. The wallet should be backed up after importing a public key.

```
importpubkey 0381dc63bc14d32743a7741dc6a2993b8384dc3aa848332194bc851ff2a371b827

null
```

### importwallet "filename"

Imports keys from a wallet dump file (see `dumpwallet`). Requires a new wallet backup after this command. Use the full path to the dump file. Evo-qt will show a status of "Importing" for a while, then "Scanning" as it rescans the blockchain. This command may take five minutes or more to return, and the wallet may appear to freeze during this time.

On a PC with the dump file in a folder "Backups" on the Desktop:

```
importwallet "C:\Users\<username>\Desktop\Backups\dump 2019-01-14.txt"

null
```

### invalidateblock "blockhash"

Hidden command. Permanently marks a block as invalid, as if it violated a consensus rule. Used for software testing or in some rare manual blockchain forking scenarios. Use `reconsiderblock` to reverse this command. Returns "null" if successful.
     

```
invalidateblock 263f7ab042135cb0e5479afd8385a237f8eb44b86135d29b34eb0fa82cc815f

null
```

### keypoolrefill ( newsize )

Refills the key pool with new private keys, with a default size of 100. The normal size of the keypool is 1,000 and the wallet opportunistically fills the keypool as addresses are used, so this command should use a 1,100 size, etc., to be meaningful. The wallet must be unlocked. evo-qt returns "null", evod returns nothing.

```
keypoolrefill 1100

null
```

### listaccounts ( minconf include_watchonly)

DEPRECATED. Returns information about account names and account balances. Gives the balance in Satoshis (EVO x 0.00000001), including the default undefined account.

This "account" was an attempt to manually track balances from bitcoin which will be removed by version 0.17, because it doesn't work well, for example, returning negative values:

```
listaccounts

### listunspent ( minconf maxconf  ["addresses",...] [include_unsafe] [query_options])

Returns array of unspent transaction outputs, which can be sorted by number of confirmations or for a specific address.

```
listunspent

[
  {
    "txid": "d36ba8beb38c7118b3bc6e8c90d54b58d7d53ef603c49039df2abb5d160ea",

### listwallets

Gives the currently loaded wallet.dat file, usually "wallet.dat" unless you can load a different file with "Restore Wallet".

```
listwallets

[
  "wallet1132019.dat"
]
```


### lockunspent unlock ([{"txid":"txid","vout":n},...])

Updates list of temporarily unspendable outputs. Temporarily lock (unlock=false as shown below) or unlock (unlock=true) the specified transaction outputs. If no transactions are specified when unlocking then all current locked transactions are unlocked.

A locked transaction output will not be chosen by automatic coin selection when spending EVO.

Locks are stored in memory only. Wallets launch with zero locked outputs and the locked output list is always cleared (by virtue of process exit) when a wallet stops or fails. Also see the `listunspent` call.
     

```
lockunspent false "[{\"txid\":\"9fc384b55230ca1899dd1acf081033ebf57ae0335abf692c4f8a6336befc2f6\",\"vout\":1}]"

true
```

### logging ( <include> <exclude> )

Gets and sets the logging configuration for the debug.log file. When called without an argument, returns the list of categories with status that are currently being debug logged or not. When called with arguments, adds or removes categories from debug logging. The arguments are evaluated in order "include" then "exclude". If an item is both included and excluded, it will thus end up being excluded.

The valid logging categories are: net, tor, mempool, http, bench, zmq, db, rpc, estimatefee, addrman, selectcoins, reindex, cmpctblock, rand, prune, proxy, mempoolrej, libevent, coindb, qt, leveldb, coinstake, and http-poll.

Here we turn on logging for "mempool" and "mempoolrej" (they are listed first for "include") and turn off "http". Returns the current debug logging status.

```
logging "[\"mempool\", \"mempoolrej\"]" "[\"http\"]"

{
  "net": 0,
  "tor": 0,
  "mempool": 1,
  "http": 0,
  "bench": 0,
  "zmq": 0,
  "db": 0,
  "rpc": 0,
  "estimatefee": 0,
  "addrman": 0,

  "libevent": 0,
  "coindb": 0,
  "qt": 0,
  "leveldb": 0,
  "coinstake": 0,
  "http-poll": 0
}
```

### move "fromaccount" "toaccount" amount ( minconf "comment" )

DEPRECATED. Move a specified amount from one account in your wallet to another. Returns "true" if the command can be parsed, whether or not the accounts exist or the movement took place.

```
move "Test Addr" "LTCp2shsegwit" 1.1

true
```

### ping

Requests that a ping be sent to other peers, to measure ping time. Results are provided in `getpeerinfo`, "pingtime" and "pingwait" fields are decimal seconds (does not provide a direct result like using "ping" from a system command prompt). The ping command is handled in queue with all other commands, so it measures processing backlog, not just network ping.
   

```
ping

null
```

### preciousblock "blockhash"

Prioritizes a block with an earlier time for blocks at the same height. Used in hard fork situations. See also `invalidateblock`. evo-qt returns "null" if successful, evod returns nothing if successful.

```
preciousblock 854d57da75ba7550aebe83c1cdf539ac685d735684b7c40cfd639582abf43b

null
```

### prioritisetransaction <txid> <dummy value> <fee delta>

Accepts the transaction into mined blocks at a higher (or lower) priority. A higher fee is not actually paid, the algorithm for selecting transactions into a block (which is trying to maximize fees) considers the transaction as having paid a higher fee. Evo-qt and evod return "true":

```
prioritisetransaction "01b347eb32bca5cde81444f6a6d4311f02ae3f3da25394e0f144fca525218dd" 0.0 10000

true
```

### pruneblockchain

Prune the blockchain up to a given block. Pruning removes spent transactions to reduce the storage size for the blockchain. Returns the last block pruned. The wallet must be launched in prune mode with disk working space reserved, at least 550 MB, here with 2 GB of working space:
      

```
evo-qt.exe -prune=2000
```
     

Then you can give the command

```
pruneblockchain 125000

125000
```
     

Don't prune the blockchain if your wallet accepts incoming connections (over 8 peers) because your wallet needs to be able to send all the blocks to bootstrap new peers coming online.

### reconsiderblock "blockhash"

Hidden command. Removes invalidity status of a block and its descendants, used for code testing or in manual blockchain reorganization. This command can reverse the effects of `invalidateblock`. Returns "null" if successful:
     

```
reconsiderblock 263f7ab042135cb0e5479afd8385a237f8eb44b86135d29b34eb0fa82cc815f

null
```

### removeprunedfunds "txid"

Deletes the specified transaction from the wallet. Meant for use with pruned wallets and as a companion to `importprunedfunds`. This will affect wallet balances. Evo-cli returns "null".

```
removeprunedfunds "535e2bf90fda10c8c8186c4c73ac2861cb19312507b9e4552e78a6148030f19f"

null
```

### rescanblockchain ("start_height") ("stop_height")

Rescan the local blockchain for wallet transactions. An optional start height and stop height can be used, or by default scan the entire blockchain. This command will scan the blockchain for transactions of your wallet, and can be used if the wallet balance doesn't appear to be correct after a wallet restore or adding private keys. Returns the start and top height scanned.

```
rescanblockchain 100000 200000

{
  "start_height": 100000,
  "stop_height": 200000
}
```

### resendwallettransactions

Hidden command. Immediately re-broadcast unconfirmed wallet transactions to all peers. The wallet periodically re-broadcasts automatically, so this can be used for testing. Here two transactions were resent after being stuck in the local mempool after restarting the wallet.

```
resendwallettransactions

[
  "8b4c25d4959cd43f6ee2ce5ab397ca32860dd6c4f2c0d83e9631aa137803124ed",
  "f5c615ca95bc324bebca4823a4ff972dc0a3950d6d7d398f238df935c5bb713c4"
]
```

### reservebalance [<reserve> [amount]]

Sets the amount of coins that will not be used for staking and can be sent immediately vs. waiting 500 confirmations after staking is turned off. Returns the reserve status and amount.

```
reservebalance true 50

{
  "reserve": true,
  "amount": 50.00000000
}
```

### savemempool

Writes the memory pool to disk in the mempool.dat file. Evo-qt returns "null", evod has no response.

```
savemempool

null
```

### searchlogs <fromBlock> <toBlock> (address) (topics)

Return the smart contract log events between two blocks (inclusive). The command requires `-logevents` to be enabled on wallet startup. Use the contract address hash if desired.
     

```
searchlogs 274690 274700

Hidden command. Waits for all the asynchronous validation queues (for the blockchain, mempool, etc.) to complete. For use by developers. Evo-qt returns "null", evod returns nothing.

```
syncwithvalidationinterfacequeue

null
```

### uptime

Gives the wallet uptime (since starting) in seconds.

```
uptime

12592
```

See `signmessage` for creating a message signature.

### verifytxoutproof "proof"

Verifies that a proof points to a transaction in a block, returning the transaction if found or giving an empty tring or error not found in the best chain. The "proof" is the hex string from `gettxoutproof`.
   
   
```
verifytxoutproof 00000020a8/<snip/>d38abf491d

[

```
   

### waitforblock <blockhash> (timeout)

Hidden command. Used to monitor when blockchain reloading has reached a given block. For command line interfaces like evod (not for the evo-qt GUI wallet), the command returns after the given block is loaded. This example waits for Mainnet block 150,000:

```
evo-cli waitforblock ae4699ac0a8f4d1170767167fd3b0639312850ce33dcb55a0afd0f5c1a88406f

{
  "hash": "ae4699ac0a8f4d1170767167fd3b0639312850ce33dcb55a0afd0f5c1a88406f",
  "height": 150000
}
```

### waitforblockheight <height> (timeout)

Hidden command. Waits for (at least) block height and returns the height and blockhash of the current tip (highest block). Returns the current block on timeout or exit. Timeout is given in milliseconds, 0 or default is no timeout. This command only works from the command line (not with the evo-qt GUI wallet) and is used for development.

On Docker regtest:

```
docker exec myapp qcli waitforblockheight 7210

{
  "hash": "b5bd2dfa428effb185a31513315bbae6284ab59b9942759e07d9110770ae9c61",
  "height": 7210
}
```
     

On Mainnet with evod:

```
evo-cli waitforblockheight 281985

{
  "hash": "44f6a6909b255f9932e28322174c6eec201790d84e7d4f9c201c92594914d240",
  "height": 281985
}
```

### waitforlogs (fromBlock) (toBlock) (filter) (minconf)

requires `-logevents` to be enabled

Waits for a new logs and returns matching log entries. When the call returns, it also specifies the next block number to start waiting for new logs. By calling waitforlogs repeatedly using the returned `nextBlock` number, a client can receive a stream of up-to-date log entries.

This call is different from the similarly named `searchlogs`. This call returns individual matching log entries, `searchlogs` returns a transaction receipt if one of the log entries of that transaction matches the filter conditions.

Arguments:
1. fromBlock (int | "latest", optional, default=null) The block number to start looking for logs. ()
2. toBlock   (int | "latest", optional, default=null) The block number to stop looking for logs. If null, will wait indefinitely into the future.
3. filter    ({ addresses?: Hex160String[], topics?: Hex256String[] }, optional default={}) Filter conditions for logs. Addresses and topics are specified as array of hexadecimal strings
4. minconf   (uint, optional, default=6) Minimal number of confirmations before a log is returned

Example TO COME.

### waitfornewblock (timeout)

Hidden command. Waits for a new block and returns the blockhash and height. Returns the current block on timeout or exit. This command works on command line only (not with the evo-qt GUI wallet) and is used for development. The timeout parameter is given in milliseconds and 0 indicates no timeout.

On Docker with regtest:

```
waitfornewblock

{
  "hash": "47f1ddc856ba47a242cbdc771d198296f3a1343f81aad21d454bec438972868c",
  "height": 7207
}
```
     

On Mainnet with evod:

```
evo-cli waitfornewblock

{
  "hash": "b4caac261c4f5386076bbb07e0dc94b92fb67ca740b8a5d7b49cddcaffd6f103",
  "height": 281981
}
```

### walletlock

Locks an encrypted wallet.

```
walletlock

null
```
     

evo-cli returns no response, but you can check with `getwalletinfo` for "unlocked_until": 0 and check the padlock icon on evo-qt.

### walletpassphrase "passphrase" timeout ( true )

Unlock an encrypted wallet for transactions which require use of a private key, such as sending coins, staking, or exporting private keys. Timeout gives the time in seconds to unlock and the optional Boolean "true" allows unlocking for staking only.
 
This command would unlock the wallet for 10 minutes:

```
walletpassphrase "you should always use a long and strong passphrase" 600
```


This command would unlock the wallet for staking only for a long time:

```
walletpassphrase "you should always use a long and strong passphrase" 99999999 true
```
     

The evo-qt wallet will show lock status with the padlock icon and the Console returns "null". evo-cli returns no status but you can check the unlock status with `getwalletinfo` for "unlocked_until": <Unix timestamp>

### walletpassphrasechange "oldpassphrase" "newpassphrase"

Changes the wallet passphrase from "oldpassphrase" to "newpassphrase", evo-qt returns "null", evod returns nothing.

```
walletpassphrasechange "you should always use a long and strong passphrase" "please use a strong and long passphrase"

null

```

```
