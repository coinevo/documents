### Deploy Evo Compute engine

Evo isn't too hungry on resources, so you should be able to deploy a VM with only 1gb of ram and it'll work fine. Adding SWAP is always recommended to ensure further stability.

At the time of writing, the Evo blockchain weighs 4.4GB, please choose at least 8GB for your disk.
