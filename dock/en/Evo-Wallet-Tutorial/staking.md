# Staking Evo on Desktop OS (Windows, Mac and Linux)

n order for staking to take place we must:

1. Have a transaction with more than 500 confirmations on the blockchain
2. Unlock our wallet prior to staking (preferably before reaching 500 confirmations on your inputs).
3. Keep our wallet open at all times, otherwise even if our coins are matured, they won’t be able to stake.

**Remember to have your wallet open 24/7, if you close it, you won’t be able to stake**
