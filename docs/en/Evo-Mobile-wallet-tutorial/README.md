# EVO Mobile Wallet

## Getting started

Once we've installed our Evo wallet either from the Apple App Store or Google Play store, we can open the wallet and we get this screen

#### Here we're offered two options:

* Create a new wallet
* Import Wallet (restore from backup) this will ask us for our seed words which are generated when the wallet is created



#### Create PIN

Once we create a new wallet, we'll be asked to create a PIN. We can either use this PIN or use Touch ID which is offered on. the next screen.



#### Enable Touch ID

Touch ID is just a very cool feature to have, it's secure and makes it faster to unlock your wallet, however you can choose not to use Touch ID and just use the pin code you'll set up during the wallet creation.

These are our seed words, we need to make backup of these words in order to be able to restore our wallet in any situation. Please back these words up securely, paper backup is recommended, **<u>without these seed words, you will not be able to restore your wallet.</u>**

On this sample, we also copied the words directly from the wallet which allows us to store them in a notes app.

Once all this is done, we're greeted with our Evo wallet.
